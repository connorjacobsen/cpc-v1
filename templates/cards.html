We offer one-sided or two-sided cards, in six popular sizes. Your postcards will be printed on your choice of our three different high-quality cover stocks (many printers use rough uncoated stock for the back side). Also, you have the option of brilliant four-color process printing on one side or both sides. We can mail your postcards directly to your customers and prospects. We can mail your brochures directly to your customers and prospects. For details on how we can save you time and money on your direct mail brochure project, give us a call or email us and we can discuss with you your bulk mail or first class mail options.</p>

	<p><strong>Full Color Business Cards</strong> are a good way to set you apart from the competition! We offer one-sided or two-sided cards, all printed on any of our three high quality cover stock options. Your business card can be your most effective marketing tool, so make it count. Instead of wasting money on run-of-the-mill 2-color cards, go for the professional look of full color. You can include your own picture, product images, or bright graphics. Either way, you don't have to worry about getting lost in the shuffle. Business cards are ordered in increments of 500 cards. You pay one low price for the first 500, and even less for additional batches of 500. Plus, there is <code>NO EXTRA CHARGE</code> for different names. So go ahead and get cards for everyone in your company. Your staff will be proud to hand them out all over town.</p>
	<p><strong>Greeting Cards</strong> (5 x 7 folded) and Note Cards (4 ¼ x 5 ½ folded) are a perennial favorite. To make the most of your color images, your cards can be printed on 10 pt C1S bristol stock, glossy on the outside and uncoated on the inside, 120# dull matte or 100# uncoated cover stock, all good for handwritten inscriptions, or on 120 # gloss cover stock, glossy on both sides. You can either leave the inside of your card blank, or have a message printed in black or color. All greeting and note cards come scored to make folding easy. We'll fold them for you for a slight additional charge. Plus, we offer premium #1 vellum blank envelopes to go with your greeting cards for just $0.6 each, including free shipping.</p>
